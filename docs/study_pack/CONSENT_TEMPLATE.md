## INTRODUCTION

You are being invited to participate in a research study. This form provides information to help you decide whether to participate. Please read it carefully and ask questions about anything you do not understand.

Your participation is voluntary. You may choose not to participate or to stop participating at any time without penalty.

---

## PURPOSE OF THE STUDY

The purpose of this study is to understand how radiologists use artificial intelligence (AI) suggestions when interpreting mammography images. We want to measure whether AI helps, hinders, or has no effect on diagnostic decisions.

---

## WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I PARTICIPATE?

If you agree to participate, you will:

1. **Complete a demographics survey** (~5 minutes)
   - Professional background, years of experience, mammography volume

2. **Complete a platform tutorial** (~10 minutes)
   - Learn how to use the Evidify research platform
   - Practice with sample cases

3. **Interpret calibration cases** (~10 minutes)
   - 2 training cases with immediate feedback
   - Helps calibrate your expectations

4. **Interpret study cases** (~3-4 hours total)
   - Approximately 100 mammography cases
   - You may complete this across multiple sessions
   - For each case, you will:
     - Review the mammogram images
     - Provide your initial BI-RADS assessment
     - See an AI suggestion (timing varies by study condition)
     - Confirm or change your assessment
     - Document any rationale for changes

5. **Complete a post-study survey** (~10 minutes)
   - Questions about your experience with the AI system
   - Cognitive workload assessment (NASA-TLX)

**Total time commitment: 4-6 hours**

---

## DATA COLLECTION

The research platform will automatically record:

- Your BI-RADS assessments (initial and final)
- Confidence ratings you provide
- Time spent on each case and each step
- How you interacted with the images (zoom, pan, etc.)
- Written rationale for any assessment changes

All data is linked to a study ID, not your name.

---

## RANDOMIZATION

You will be randomly assigned to one of several conditions that determine:
- When you see the AI suggestion (before, during, or after your initial assessment)
- What information you receive about the AI's error rates

This randomization is automatic and managed by the platform.

---

## RISKS

This study involves **minimal risk**.

- **No patient care decisions**: All cases are retrospective with known outcomes
- **No physical risks**: Study is computer-based
- **Possible discomfort**: Some participants may feel frustration if their assessments differ from AI or ground truth
- **Time burden**: The study requires several hours of your time

---

## BENEFITS

**Direct benefits:**
- You may receive [continuing medical education credit / honorarium] for your participation
- You will gain experience with AI-assisted interpretation

**Indirect benefits:**
- Your participation contributes to scientific understanding of human-AI interaction
- Findings may improve future AI system design

---

## COMPENSATION

You will receive [DESCRIBE COMPENSATION: e.g., "$X per hour", "X CME credits", "Amazon gift card"].

If you withdraw early, you will be compensated for the time you have completed.

---

## CONFIDENTIALITY

Your data will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law.

- Your responses are linked to a study ID, not your name
- Only approved research personnel have access to the data
- Data is stored on secure, encrypted servers
- Published results will not identify individual participants
- De-identified data may be shared with collaborating researchers

---

## VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION

Your participation is voluntary. You may:
- Choose not to participate
- Stop at any time without penalty
- Skip questions you do not wish to answer
- Request deletion of your data

If you decide to stop, simply close the browser window or contact the research team.

## DATA INTEGRITY VERIFICATION

This study uses cryptographic methods to ensure data integrity.

- Each interaction you make is timestamped and hashed
- The complete data chain can be verified for tampering
- This protects both the research and you as a participant
