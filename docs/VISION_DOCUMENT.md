# Evidify Vision Document
## Updated January 9, 2026

## Vision Statement (Full Narrative)

Evidify is a local-first clinical documentation and learning platform built around how behavioral health clinicians actually grow. In training, a clinician debriefs with a supervisor after a session: what happened, what mattered, what was missed, what felt difficult, and what should be done next. The supervisor reflects the clinician's account back to them, organizes it, identifies blind spots, and helps scaffold better clinical judgment over time.

Evidify brings that same supervision-grade debrief loop into everyday practice—without sending PHI to the cloud. It helps clinicians capture the clinical story efficiently, convert it into high-quality documentation, and then use that documentation to sharpen formulation, treatment planning, risk vigilance, and professional self-protection.

Built by a clinician with more than a decade of real-world experience across settings, populations, and documentation standards, Evidify combines practical clinical workflow with the best of on-device AI. It is designed to augment the clinician's skill—while actively avoiding the failures clinicians fear most: HIPAA exposure, patient harm, and indefensible documentation.

Evidify starts where the burden is most acute: documentation. By reducing after-hours note writing and improving completeness and consistency, it decreases burnout and returns time and attention to the work that matters—being present with clients. From there, the platform expands into a broader mission: improving clinical insight and outcomes through better capture, better reflection, and better follow-through—session by session, over time, and always under clinician control.

## Vision Statement (Short, Executive)

Evidify is a local-first AI documentation and clinical reasoning platform for behavioral health. It turns the post-session "supervision debrief" into an on-device workflow: capture what happened, structure it into a defensible note, flag clinical risk and documentation gaps, and support stronger formulation and treatment planning—without sending PHI to the cloud. The result is faster documentation, better clinical thinking, and reduced audit anxiety, so clinicians can focus more on clients and less on paperwork.

## One-Liners

**For clinicians:**
Evidify is an offline AI "supervisor debrief" that turns your session recap into a strong note—and helps you think more clearly about what to do next.

**For compliance / IT:**
Evidify is a local-first documentation layer that uses on-device AI to generate defensible behavioral health notes with zero PHI egress.

**For investors:**
Evidify is the only AI documentation platform that behavioral health clinicians can use without asking permission—because PHI never leaves their device.

## Recording with Consent (Phrasing Options)

**Option A (simple):**
"Optional session audio capture is available only with explicit informed consent and clinician-controlled settings; audio can be disabled at any time and is stored locally."

**Option B (more formal):**
"When enabled, Evidify supports clinician-initiated audio capture workflows that require documented informed consent and configurable retention controls. Audio and transcripts remain on-device by default."

**Option C (telehealth-friendly):**
"Evidify supports post-session voice debriefing and, when appropriate and permitted, consent-based audio capture—always under clinician control and stored locally."

**Proactive framing:**
"Audio capture exists because spoken debriefs are richer than typed notes—not because the system needs more data. The clinician controls when, whether, and how long any audio is retained."

## Product Philosophy (North Star Principles)

**1. Clinical-first**
Designed around how clinicians think, document, and learn—not around generic AI prompting.

**2. Local-first by default**
Core functionality works offline; PHI stays on-device unless the clinician explicitly chooses otherwise.

**3. Defensibility as a feature**
Structured notes, completion checks, and tamper-evident history support audit and board defense.

**4. Risk-aware augmentation**
The system surfaces safety and documentation risk signals; the clinician decides.

**5. Learning loop**
Documentation is not just compliance—it is feedback that improves clinical judgment over time. Longitudinal pattern detection across sessions reveals trajectory changes, formulation drift, and intervention gaps—turning documentation into a clinical mirror.

## The Verifiable Trust Claim

Disconnect from the internet. The app works identically. That's the proof.

This isn't marketing—it's a testable assertion any clinician can verify in 30 seconds. No other AI documentation platform can make this claim.
