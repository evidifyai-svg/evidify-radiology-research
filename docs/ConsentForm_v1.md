# Consent to On-Device Session Audio Capture for Documentation Support (Evidify)

**What this is:** Your clinician uses Evidify to help write accurate documentation while staying focused on you during sessions.

## 1) What is being recorded
- Audio only from our session (no video by default).
- The recording may capture your voice and anything audible in the environment.

## 2) Why we are recording
- To help the clinician create an accurate clinical note efficiently.
- To reduce clinician distraction and increase attention during session.
- To support completeness of documentation (e.g., symptoms discussed, interventions used, plan).

## 3) Where the recording is stored
- On the clinician’s device only.
- Not uploaded to the cloud.
- Stored encrypted on the device.

## 4) Who can access it
- The treating clinician only.
- If your clinic uses supervision/QA review, a supervisor may access the note unless you separately consent to audio sharing.

## 5) How long it is kept (default: immediate destruction)
- Default: the audio is automatically destroyed after the clinician generates the session note.
- Exception: if you request retention for a specific reason or clinic policy requires retention, this will be discussed and documented.

## 6) Not used for training / not shared
- The recording and derived content are not used to train public AI models.
- It will not be sold or shared for marketing.

## 7) Your choices and control
- Optional. You can say no and still receive care.
- You may request pause, stop, or do not record future sessions at any time.
- You may revoke consent mid-session; recording will stop.

## 8) Risks and limitations
- If other people can hear or be heard, their voices may be captured.
- No system is risk-free; device compromise is a risk, mitigated by encryption and access controls.

## 9) Location and legal requirements
- Recording consent requirements can vary by where you are located.
- You agree to tell your clinician what state you are physically in for each recorded session.

## 10) Consent
By signing, you consent to on-device audio capture for documentation support as described above.
