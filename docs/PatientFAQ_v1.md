# Evidify On-Device Recording — Patient FAQ (v1)

## What does Evidify record?
Audio only (by default). It may capture anything audible during the session.

## Where does the audio go?
It stays on the clinician’s device. It is not sent to the cloud.

## Why record at all?
To help the clinician create an accurate clinical note while staying focused on you.

## Is this required?
No. You can decline and still receive the same care.

## Can I stop it?
Yes. You can ask to pause or stop recording at any time.

## Is it used to train AI?
No. The recording and derived content are not used to train public AI models.

## How long is it kept?
Default is immediate destruction after the note is generated. If there is a reason to retain it, your clinician will discuss it with you and document the plan.

## What if someone else is nearby?
If possible, use a private space. If others might be heard, the clinician may not record unless all relevant parties consent (depending on location and policy).
