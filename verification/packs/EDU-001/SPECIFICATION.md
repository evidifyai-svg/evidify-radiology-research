# EDU-001 — 504/IEP Gate Pack (v0.1)

**Purpose:** seed fixture pack for the EDU module. This pack is intentionally minimal in v0.1; it becomes CI-enforced in v0.2.

## Gates (initial draft)

- **GATE-EDU-001 (Authority/Consent):** A consent record (or legal authority basis) exists for evaluation activities.
- **GATE-EDU-002 (Timeline Consistency):** Referral, consent, evaluation, meeting dates do not conflict.
- **GATE-EDU-003 (Basis Links):** Each recommendation links to supporting data sources or is explicitly marked as team decision.

## Golden reports

- `golden/gate_report.canon.json`: expected canonical gate report (PASS/WARN/FAIL)

## Evidence

In v0.1, evidence is a placeholder. In v0.2, `evidence/EDU-001.zip` will contain canonical inputs.
