# Recording guide (PHI-free)

Goal: 2–5 minute clips that let reviewers assess workflow friction and trust/verification UX.

## CC-001-PASS-workflow.mp4
Capture:
1. Launch app (show version if visible)
2. Import/open CC-001 dataset
3. Navigate to gates/trust strip
4. Run Export+Verify
5. Show successful verification screen (canonical hash shown if available)

## BIG-001-FAIL-workflow.mp4
Capture:
1. Import/open BIG-001 dataset
2. Show gate failures and how they are explained
3. Attempt at least one remediation action (even if it cannot be fixed)
4. Export+Verify and show failure output

## Tips
- Ensure no real names, emails, or PHI are visible.
- If a file picker shows paths with identifying info, blur or avoid showing the picker.
- If feasible, narrate expectations vs what happened (e.g., “I expect deterministic hash X; I got Y.”)
