## 2. Approved Claims

### ✅ CAN SAY (Verified, Defensible)

| Claim | Justification |
|-------|---------------|
| "Local-first" | All data stored locally, no cloud sync required |
| "Offline capable" | Core features work without internet after initial setup |
| "Provable privacy" | No data leaves device; verifiable via network isolation |
| "Complete audit trail" | Every action logged with cryptographic chain |
| "Deterministic exports" | Same input produces byte-identical output |
| "Court-defensible" | Designed for Daubert/Frye scrutiny (not legal guarantee) |
| "AI-assisted, human-verified" | All AI output requires explicit human review |
| "7-gate defensibility framework" | Based on forensic psychology best practices |

### ⚠️ QUALIFIED CLAIMS (Requires Context)

| Claim | Required Qualification |
|-------|------------------------|
| "Saves X hours per report" | Must cite user study or beta data; currently "up to 45 minutes saved monthly" based on estimates |
| "Faster than traditional workflow" | Must specify compared to what; "compared to manual documentation" |
| "HIPAA-ready" | "Designed to support HIPAA compliance; consult your compliance officer" |
| "Tamper-evident" | "Detects modification after export; does not prevent all tampering" |

### ❌ CANNOT SAY (Avoid These)

| Claim | Why Not |
|-------|---------|
| "HIPAA compliant" | Compliance is organizational, not product-level |
| "Legally guaranteed" | No software can guarantee legal outcomes |
| "100% secure" | No security claim is absolute |
| "Prevents malpractice" | Cannot guarantee practice outcomes |
| "Better than [competitor]" | Avoid direct competitive claims |
| "AI writes your report" | Misrepresents human-in-the-loop design |
| "Certified by [authority]" | Unless we have actual certification |

## 3. Differentiators (What Makes Us Unique)

### Primary Differentiator: Daubert Pack

**Claim:** "Export a complete defensibility package that documents every AI interaction, human review, and data provenance."

**Proof points:**
- Audit chain with cryptographic hashes
- Gate evaluation with specific defensibility criteria
- Human review attestation for all AI content
- Evidence inventory with source hashes

### Secondary Differentiators

| Feature | Claim |
|---------|-------|
| Local-first architecture | "Your data never leaves your device" |
| 7-gate framework | "Systematic defensibility checks before export" |
| Stable finding IDs | "Track issues across versions without ID churn" |
| Sentinel-based hashing | "Self-verifiable exports without external dependencies" |

## 4. Target Audience Messaging

### For Forensic Psychologists

**Pain point:** "I spend more time documenting than evaluating."

**Message:** "Evidify handles the documentation burden so you can focus on clinical judgment. Every AI suggestion is traceable, every opinion is anchored to evidence, and every export is court-ready."

### For Forensic Practice Groups

**Pain point:** "We can't scale evaluations without sacrificing quality."

**Message:** "Evidify's defensibility framework ensures consistent quality across your team. One-week turnaround times without compromising thoroughness."

### For Attorneys (Retaining Expert)

**Pain point:** "Will this expert's methodology hold up under cross?"

**Message:** "Evidify-generated reports include a complete audit trail. Every opinion links to supporting evidence. Every AI interaction is documented and reviewed. Your expert's methodology is transparent and defensible."

## 5. Conference/Presentation Guidelines

### AP-LS / AFCC Presentations

**Approved topics:**
- AI ethics in forensic documentation

- Workflow efficiency in high-volume practices

**Approach:**
- Lead with the problem (documentation burden, defensibility concerns)

- Demo workflow (if approved)
- Avoid hard selling; focus on education

### Slides Must Include

- "Confidential - Pre-release" watermark if showing unreleased features
- Disclaimer: "Designed for defensibility; not a guarantee of legal outcomes"

### Do Not Present

- Specific client/case examples (even anonymized, too risky)

- Direct competitor comparisons
- Unverified claims about time savings

## 6. Discovery Posture

### What We Can Produce

If subpoenaed or requested in discovery:

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| gate_report.canon.json | PHI-safe, shows methodology |
| audit_digest.json | PHI-safe, shows event counts |
| Export folder structure | Contract is public |
| Verification process docs | Public specification |

### What Requires Privilege Review

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| canonical.json | Contains case content |
| audit.log full | May contain case references |
| Evidence files | Protected work product |
| AI generation logs | May contain case content |

### Protective Order Recommendations

For cases involving Evidify exports:
- Request protective order for canonical.json and audit.log
- gate_report.canon.json can typically be produced without restriction
- Verification documentation is not privileged
