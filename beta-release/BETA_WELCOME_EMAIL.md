## What You're Testing

**Evidify** is a local-first clinical documentation platform. The core promise:

> **90 seconds of speaking → complete structured note**
> 
> All processing happens on YOUR device. No PHI ever leaves your computer.

### Key Features to Test

1. **Voice Scribe** - Speak naturally about your session, get a structured note
2. **Ethics Detection** - Automatic flagging of safety concerns and documentation gaps
3. **Time Metrics** - Track exactly how much time you're saving
4. **Offline Mode** - Disconnect from internet; app works identically

---

## Getting Started (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Install Prerequisites

**Ollama** (required for AI features):
- macOS/Linux: `curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh`
- Windows: Download from https://ollama.ai/download

After installing, open Terminal/Command Prompt and run:
```
ollama pull llama3.2
```

### Step 2: Install Evidify

See the attached **Installation Guide** for platform-specific instructions.

### Step 3: First Launch

1. Open Evidify
2. Complete the onboarding wizard (2-3 minutes)
3. Create your secure vault (choose a memorable passphrase)
4. Add a test client

## Ground Rules

1. **Don't rely solely on Evidify** - Keep your backup documentation method active
2. **Keep it confidential** - Don't share the software or discuss features publicly
3. **No PHI in feedback** - Scrub any screenshots or descriptions
4. **Be honest** - Critical feedback is more valuable than polite feedback

- 🔴 Crashes/Data Loss: < 24 hours

- 🟡 Questions: Within the week

**How to Reach Me:**
- Email: [YOUR_EMAIL]

## Timeline

- **Weeks 1-2:** Get comfortable, find rough edges
- **Weeks 3-4:** Use it for real documentation, push the limits
- **Weeks 5-6:** Final feedback, help prioritize launch features
- **After Beta:** Early access to v1.0, grandfathered pricing

---

## One Last Thing

You're not just testing software. You're helping build something that could give clinicians back thousands of hours and reduce burnout across the profession.

Your feedback matters. Don't hold back.

Let's make documentation disappear.

Best,

**Josh**  
Founder, Evidify

P.S. - The first person to find a critical bug gets a lifetime license when we launch. 🎯
