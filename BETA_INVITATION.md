# Evidify Beta — Research Documentation That Stays on Your Device

**Looking for:** Psychologists, psychiatrists, therapists, and other mental health practitioners willing to test a new documentation tool.

---

## The Problem We're Solving

You know the drill: finish a session, spend 15+ minutes writing notes, repeat all day. Meanwhile, "AI scribe" tools are everywhere—but they want to send your patients' most sensitive information to cloud servers. Your IT department says no. Your ethics say no. HIPAA says... it's complicated.

**What if the AI ran entirely on your laptop?**

---

## What Evidify Is

Evidify is a research documentation app where **all AI processing happens locally on your Mac**. No cloud. No uploads. No "trust us, we anonymize it." The model runs in your computer's memory, and your notes never leave your device.

### What It Does

- **Voice capture** — Talk through your session notes, get a transcript
- **AI structuring** — Raw notes → SOAP format (or other templates) in seconds
- **Risk flagging** — Automatically highlights SI/HI/abuse content for your review
- **Attestation workflow** — Document that you addressed flagged items before signing
- **Longitudinal insights** — Spots patterns across sessions (symptom trends, documentation gaps)
- **Encrypted storage** — AES-256 encryption, passphrase required every session

### What It Doesn't Do

- Send data anywhere
- Make decisions for you
- Add information you didn't write
- Replace your judgment

## Why Local Matters

| Cloud AI Scribes | Evidify |
|------------------|---------|
| Your notes go to their servers | Notes stay on your device |
| "Trust us" privacy policies | Verifiable—works offline |
| IT/compliance headaches | InfoSec can approve day one |
| PHI in prompts = risk | PHI never leaves your machine |

---

## What Beta Testers Would Do

1. **Install the app** on your Mac (M1/M2/M3 recommended, Intel works too)
2. **Use it for documentation** — even just a few notes per week helps
3. **Give feedback** — Does the AI output match your intent? Are risk flags accurate? What's missing?

**Time commitment:** Whatever fits your workflow. Even 2-3 notes gives us useful data.

**What you get:** Early access to a tool that might actually save you time without the privacy tradeoffs. And input into how it develops.

## Current Status

This is a **working beta**, not a mockup. Core features are functional:

- ✅ Encrypted vault with passphrase protection
- ✅ Client management and note creation
- ✅ AI-assisted note structuring (requires ~5GB model download, one time)
- ✅ Risk detection and attestation workflow
- ✅ Longitudinal analysis (patterns across sessions)
- ⚡ Voice transcription (functional, being refined)

**Not ready yet:** Polished UI, installer packages, mobile app

---

## Requirements

- **Mac** running macOS 12+ (Monterey or newer)
- **8GB RAM** minimum, 16GB recommended
- **~10GB disk space** for app + AI model
- Willingness to run a couple terminal commands during setup (we'll walk you through it)

Windows version coming, but Mac is the focus for this beta.

## Who's Building This

This is being developed by a clinical psychologist (PhD, Fordham) who conducts 200+ evaluations annually and got tired of the documentation-vs-privacy tradeoff. Built for practitioners, by a practitioner.

*Questions? The most common one: "Is this really local?" Yes—disconnect your WiFi and it still works. That's the whole point.*
